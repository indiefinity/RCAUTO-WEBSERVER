# RCAUTO-WEBSERVER
This project is a web based controller for an remote controlled car that I am making with my friend(s).

The car will be controlled by a Raspberry pi running a node webserver, which you can connect to so you can control where the car goes.

It's pretty simple.

**CURRENTLY ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS!!!
